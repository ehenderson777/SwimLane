Enrique -

Thanks for taking some time to chat with me. I really enjoyed our call and think you would be a good candidate. We've recently changed our interview process and we would like you to complete a practical. It shouldn't take you more than a few hours. We would like it returned by Monday morning (5/16). Please let me know if you have any issues with meeting this deadline.

Here is what I'd like:
Author 6 Test Cases
Bug Test and author tickets
Write 10-12 Automated Tests
for this Todo Application ( http://todomvc.com/examples/angular2/  ).

Here are a few of the tools you might be interested in checking out:
https://angular.github.io/protractor/ 
http://paypal.github.io/nemo/
http://nightwatchjs.org/
https://theintern.github.io/

Please post your code on Gitthub when your done.  

Look forward to seeing what you come up with!

Thanks,

Ron Harley# SwimLane
